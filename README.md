# Automated, reproducible, transparent, Windows builds for cURL, nghttp2, libssh2, OpenSSL

  - Packaging aims to follow popular binary releases found on the Internet.
  - Static libraries are built with [LTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interprocedural_optimization) option enabled (can be linked in non-LTO mode as well.)
  - Both x86 and x64 packages are built using the same process.
  - Standalone `curl.exe` (only `msvcrt.dll` is required).
  - curl/libcurl are built with [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) support enabled.
  - The build process is fully transparent by using publicly available
    open source code, C compiler, build scripts and running the
    build [in the public](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vsz/harbour-deps), with open, auditable build logs.
  - Components are verified using SHA-256 hashes.
  - Generated binaries are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org), meaning
    they will have the same hash given the same input sources and C compiler.
    Because LTO mode doesn't support reproducibility out of the box (as of GCC 5.3),
    the `-frandom-seed=` workaround is used (with a source-version dependent value)
    to resolve this while building OpenSSL. See more on the issue here:

       * <https://reproducible.debian.net/issues/unstable/randomness_in_fat_lto_objects_issue.html>

  - Generated binaries are uploaded to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com).
