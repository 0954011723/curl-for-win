# Automated, reproducible, Windows builds for cURL, libssh2, OpenSSL

  - Packaging tries to follow other binary releases found on the Internet
  - Static libraries are built with LTO option enabled (can be linked in non-LTO mode as well)
  - Both 32-bit and 64-bit packages are built using the same process
  - Components are verified using SHA-256 hashes
  - Generated binaries are reproducible, meaning they will have the same
    hash given the same input sources and C compiler. Because LTO mode
    doesn't support reproducibility out of the box (as of GCC 5.2), the
    `-frandom-seed=` workaround is used (with a fixed value) to resolved
    this while building OpenSSL. See more on the issue here:
